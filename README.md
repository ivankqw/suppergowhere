# suppergowhere
A web app to help you choose a supper location so that you will not be burdened by surge pricing on your way back!

## How the App Works
We often hesitate about going drinking/having supper till past midnight as there are no public transport options back. Booking a Private Hire Vehicle (GoJek, Grab) is a painful cycle of seeing unreasonable surged prices and being unable to find drivers. This app alleviates your suffering by suggesting locations (based on MRT stations) to indulge in your alcohol/food. The suggestions are ranked based on the **average** number of taxis within a 500m radius. 

All you need to do is input the time and day you are planning to head back home and press 'Go'. The app would then generate the top 5 locations in descending number of taxis within a 500m radius.

*Note: I used the number of taxis as an estimation for the number of Private Hire Vehicles in the area as the live location of Private Hire Vehicles is not publicly available.*
